Airstrike
=========

**Projet de fin d'etude 2013-2014 for ASR**

[Airstrike][1] is a 2d dogfighting game being slowly developed by various people around the net. 
It is not yet playable although there is an old version which may be a bit fun to try. 
We are developing the game using only freely available tools, and we try to do everything ourselves. 
The source code and the 3d models are released under the GPL licence.

The purpose is to improve session to this game, the middleware [Pothon][2], [ZeroMQ][3], [ZebroGaMQ][4] will be used
